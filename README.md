This Python script implements basic spyware functionalities for educational and demonstrative purposes. It demonstrates various invasive actions such as capturing screenshots, recording keystrokes, monitoring clipboard activity, and uploading captured data to a remote server using SFTP.

Features:

Screenshot Capture: Captures the current screen and saves it as "screenshot.png".
Keystroke Recording: Records keystrokes continuously and saves them to "keystrokes.txt".
Clipboard Monitoring: Monitors clipboard changes and saves copied content to "clipboard.txt".
Self-Replication: Copies the script to a designated directory for self-replication.
Remote Command Execution: Executes commands remotely via a command-line interface.
Data Encryption: Encrypts sensitive data files using the gpg command-line tool.
Remote Data Upload: Uploads captured data files to a remote server using SFTP.
Usage:

Run the script without any command-line arguments to initiate spying actions indefinitely.
Use the command-line interface to execute commands remotely.
